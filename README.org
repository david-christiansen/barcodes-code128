* Code 128 Barcodes in Haskell

This is a Haskell library for generating Code 128 barcodes in PDF
format, which is described [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128][on Wikipedia]].

The width of the stripes and the height of the barcode are
configurable. Two modes of operation are supported:
 * Constructing a PDF directly in a =ByteString=, and
 * Constructing an action in HPDF's =Draw= monad, for composing the
   barcode with other drawings.

Simple heuristics are used to choose efficient coding
schemes. However, the encoding is not presently optimal.
